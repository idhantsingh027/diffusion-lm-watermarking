What is watermarking?

It is protecting models from various intellectual property violations like copyright infringement, unauthorized use and modification of the model.
Model owners must be aware of these potential risks.

What are diffusion models (DMs)?

They are generative models that generate realistic images through a sequential denoising process.
But they are not secure by design. They may be susceptible to potential misuse, theft of intellectual property.
This can lead to loss of revenue and reputation of the owner. It may enable the attacker to abuse the model such as generating fake images or videos.
